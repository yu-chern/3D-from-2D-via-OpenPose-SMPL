# 3D-from-2D-via-OpenPose-SMPL

We build a system using C++ to generate a 3D body mesh from a 2D image which contains a human with any poses and gestures.

The repository only contains the report i.e. a paper describing everything of our project. Unfortunately, the project code is not visible for public since this project is owned by a team consisting of 4 teamates.
